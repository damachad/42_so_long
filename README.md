# So_long :star:

## Introduction :rocket:

This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum, focusing on game development in 2D. The goal is to create a small game where the player has to collect all the collectibles on a map and then reach the exit. The bonus part adds enemies to avoid. The game utilizes the MiniLibX library for graphical management, enabling rendering, sprites, animations, and more.

## Project Overview :paintbrush:

In this project, you will gain valuable experience and knowledge in various aspects of game development, including:

- Creating 2D games.
- Rendering graphics.
- Managing sprites and animations.
- Implementing game logic and mechanics.
